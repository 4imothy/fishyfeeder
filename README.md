## Fishy Feeder

Fishy Feeder is a simple game where you must travel around the sea feeding (hovering over) evil fish to stop them from eating you. As time goes on you must play faster and faster to keep up.  

Fishy Feeder is a game I made late 2021. I created Fishy Feeder to learn more about how to write javascript and use script to interact with the page. This was my first project written in javascript. It is written in vanilla javascript with the exception of howler.js which was used for sound.
